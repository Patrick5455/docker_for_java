Building a DOcker image
To build a docker image, we use a dockerfile which contains some steps (started by FROM) to create our image

> First, you create a diorectory where the image would be built
> THen you create a file named 'Dockerfile'. This file contains the steps/instructions you want docker to use in buidling your image.
> Steps/instructions in Dockerfile include
1. FROM - this is always the first step. It tells docker which base image to pull form. Typically we pull from an existing image to creat our own image
2. CMD - docker containers run only one thing which they run really well. This is what we specofy in the CMD step. We specify what we want this image container(s) torun
